    <h2>What I love</h2>
    <p>
        My life finds its rhythm in two passions: being a dedicated father and the captivating world of code. While
        family always comes first, I've discovered a fulfilling balance that allows me to excel in both areas.
        Remote work grants me the flexibility to be present for my children, actively involved in their lives, while
        simultaneously pursuing my professional ambitions. This harmonious approach translates into unwavering
        dedication and a proven track record of exceeding expectations.

        Beyond the realm of fatherhood, my heart beats for open-source software and the elegance of Python. Since
        venturing into the world of Linux in 2002, I've become a staunch advocate for FOSS, actively contributing to
        user groups, organizing meetups, and fostering a vibrant community of collaboration. This fervor extends to
        Python, where its expressiveness allows me to craft code with minimal fuss and maximum impact. Joining the
        local Python User Group in 2016 ignited a journey of continuous learning, knowledge sharing, and mentoring
        others. At trivago, I spearheaded the internal Python guild, conducted trainings, and collaborated with
        local communities on events â€“ witnessing their growth fueled immense satisfaction.

        My passion extends beyond technical skills. I believe in fostering vibrant communities, empowering others
        through mentorship, and actively sharing knowledge. If you share these values and seek someone who thrives
        in a collaborative environment, let's connect!
