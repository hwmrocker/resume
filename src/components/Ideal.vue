        <h2>My ideal position</h2>
        <p>
            In my dream position, I would work with multiple teams and be available to advise on what a new architecture
            might look like. But also help with PR reviews. I would encourage knowledge sharing by hosting a guild where
            everyone can train to present. Identify knowledge gaps in teams and make sure the right training is available
            for them. Help organize internal conferences.
        </p>
        <h2>My ideal employer</h2>
        <p>
            Helps fight climate change, supports free and open source software, and gives back to the community. Supports a
            Linux development environment and values a healthy developer culture, values trust, makes decisions based on
            evidence, and allows anyone to challenge the status quo. They are not publicly traded, value their employees,
            and do not disband departments just to increase short-term profits. They have a long-term goal and a holistic
            view. They are profitable and not dependent on VC money.
        </p>

        <h2>My ideal job</h2>
        <p>
            I will earn 100k â‚¬ per year, not including bonuses. I can work from home 100% of the time. We meet in person 2-4
            times a year for a few days and focus on social interactions on those days. A good work-life balance is
            guaranteed, I can have 30 days vacation per year.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you know of a place where (almost) all of this is possible, drop me a line, some points are negotiable for
            the right employer or position.
